## Sexism on Spotify

### What is our view on "Sexism on Spotify"?

According to the article the song in the most popular tracks gets recommended more often in playlists. If the recommender system is recommending mostly tracks by male artists it may influence users, which in turn shifts the collaborative weights to recommend even more male artists.

It is then fully possible that the recommender could be stuck in loop, a loop that creates an echo chamber of male artists and users that prefer males, that future emphasizes the feedback loop and even the Spotify platform itself.

Some genres may be skewed based on how male dominated they are. Rock and rap are extremely male dominated genres so it is hard to see how these two genres would not have recommendations skewed towards men. Encouraging a more even gender balance may be needed in order to balance the more male dominated music genres.

### How do we evaluate the "Smirnoff Equalizer on Spotify"?

The Smirnoff Equalizer tool is a collaboration between Spotify and Smirnoff. The tool analyses a user’s listening habits, providing a breakdown of the percentage of male vs. female artists they listen to. The equalizer will then provide a tailored, gender-balanced playlist, with an option to adjust the number of women in said playlist.

To us, the Smirnoff Equalizer seems to be more of a marketing gimmick and band-aid for publicity than an actual attempt to bring more gender balance to the Spotify playlist recommendations.

The tool was on an external site that is no longer active, meaning we can’t officially try it and evaluate it ourselves; this brings more weight on our earlier argument that it is a marketing gimmick.

For it to have been an actual attempt to change the imbalance, the tool should have been a more permanent solution, even integrated into the Spotify-app and not been branded by a partner, and if a partner was to be even considered there is an argument to make that Smirnoff is a poor one, considering how alcohol induced behavior usually affects equality. We’d rather not discuss the Smirnoff topic future.

As for how many knew about the Smirnoff Equalizer existence, we can only make an educated guess but for a majority in our team, it was a new thing, so perhaps Spotify’s users also didn’t know of its existence.

Trying to have forced equality through the equalizer tool just a band-aid and won’t fix the underlying problem with the recommendations system being skewed heavily towards men.

### Conclusion regarding "Sexism on Spotify?"

Trying to have forced equality through the Smirnoff equalizer tool is a low effort band-aid fix and at worse a way to brush the problems aside rather than make fundamental changes in our opinion. The Smirnoff equalizer won’t fix the underlying problem with the recommendations being skewed heavily towards men. In a perfect world, the goal should be to have recommendations that aren’t biased against any gender, a neutrality if you will.

## Strategic Recommendation Bias

The paper outlines a base case where the recommender system’s goal is to maximize the consumer utility by recommending the optimal content mix. In the most basic of cases the consumer can’t search for content but has to rely on recommendations.

There are two types of content provided type A with a low royalty cost and type B with a high royalty cost. There are three types of consumers one(1) with a preference for A, consumer two(2) with a preference for a mix of A and B and a third(3) consumer that prefers type B.

### Strategic recommendation minimizing costs

In this case the platform has designed its recommendation system and adjusted its subscription price to maximize profitability by minimizing the costs.

Consumer 1 is only recommended content A. Consumer 2 is recommended a personalized mix of A and B with a bias for A and consumer 3 is provided with very biased recommendation that skews against their preferences so that they leave the platform.

Strategic recommendation can reduce royalty rates to a level lower than that obtained when the recommender system only aims at maximizing consumers’ utility.

### Use recommender system to strategically leverage content providers

By steering or threatening to steer consumers to cheaper content the platform can offer contracts with the content providers for reduced rates in exchange for increased recommendations. This can also pin content providers against each other, by having one content provider offer lower royalty rates than their competitors in exchange for more recommendations in the system.

The platform can reduce the content providers power and decrease their royalty payments by using this type of strategy.

### Vertical integration
Vertical integration is a way for the platform to reduce royalty payments. This can be done by the platform producing their own content or by merging with a content provider. This will naturally lower the royalties the platform pays.
Spotify has been bypassing record labels by licensing music directly from independent artists, in order to pay lower royalties.

The demand `for platform independent content providers will be lowered #???`. The best response for the content providers is keeping their royalties high while facing low demand.

Vertical integration will mostly benefit the platforms and harm the content providers.

### Can we imagine this becoming a real problem which will be unnoticed by users?

In the case of strategic recommendation to minimize costs. Users with a preference for content A will most likely not notice any biases in the recommendations as the system already fits with their optimal content mix, but consumers with other preferences may well notice the biased recommendations, however as the saying goes, what you don’t know won’t hurt you, this is aptly true for recommendations as it might be hard for the unaware to realize their recommendations are being altered if a platform has a shift in strategy especially if they market their change as improvement/update.

Vertical integration however is more likely to be noticed by more users than the previous case, `minimizing cost strategy #???`, especially if the contents origin is visible.

### What could be the possible risk and harm for users and artists?

By recommending users content that minimize the royalty payments to content providers, the platform will decrease the consumer utility. By minimizing costs, the users with other preferences than type A (low royalties) are affected negatively, in the form of less personalized recommendations. Users with content preference for type B (high royalties) are affected the most by biased recommendations, that in worst case may cause them to leave the platform. In turn this will then also affect content providers of content type B as their content will be recommend less and to fewer users. 

Consumer type three, who are intended to be pushed of the platform, pushes the royalties even lower for these content providers.

A biased recommender system can be used to play providers against each other with the use of special agreements to reduce the royalties in exchange for increased recommendations. This will reduce the content providers royalties more than when trying to maximize consumer utility.

By vertical integration the platforms gain more power by producing its own content or merging with a content provider. This will harm the independent content providers in the form of decreased demand. It can however lead to renegotiation with content providers to decrease royalty payments. This might cause a decrease in available content on the platform, which will negatively affect the users of type two and three.

### What is our suggestion to address this problem?

The best outcome would be to encourage platforms to recommend content based on personalized recommendations. This maximizes user utility, but the platform will have increased costs in form of royalty payments to content providers.
More transparency in different platforms content recommender systems would help negate the first case, by making it clearer for the users how the content is recommended. Perhaps it should be a consumer right to know why and how a recommendation was made to stifle the current flood of manipulation.

Content providers could also try to band together to negotiate the royalty rates in order to prevent the platforms form playing the providers against each other, a true and tested solution like unions is something we’d suggest.
To prevent too much vertical integration one of our ideas as team is to recommend newer and stronger anti-trust laws in order to prevent platforms from becoming too large and powerful. This is already an issue with almost the whole movie industry being under the same *umbrella* already.
