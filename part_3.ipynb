    "## 3.2 Strategic Recommendation Bias\n",
    "The paper outlines a base case where the RS goal is to maximize the consumer utility by recommending the optimal content mix. In the base case the consumer can’t search for content. There are two types of content provided type A with a low royalty cost and type B with a high royalty cost. There are three types of consumers one with a preference for A, a second with a preference for a mix of A and B and the third prefers type B.\n",

    "In this case the platform has set its subscription price and designed its recommendation system to maximize profitability by minimizing the costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consumer 1 is only recommended content A. Consumer 2 is recommended a personalized mix of A and B with a bias for A. Consumer 3 is provided with verry biased recommendations that are against their preferences so that they leave the platform.\n",

    "Strategic recommendation can reduce royalty rates to a level lower than that obtained when the RS only aims at maximizing consumers’ utility.\n",

    "### 3.2.3 Use RS strategically to leverage content providers\n",
    "By steer or threatening to steer consumers to cheaper content. The platform can offer contracts with the content providers for reduced rates in exchange for increased recommendations. This can also pin content providers against each other by offering lower royalty rates than their competitors in order to get more recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform can reduce the content providers power and decrease their royalty payments. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.4 Vertical integration\n",
    "Vertical integration is a way for the platform to reduce royalty payments. This can be done by producing own content or merging with a content provider. This will lower the royalties the platform pays. \n",
